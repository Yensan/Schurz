# Schurz

A Web Framework build from Flask. Its source file structure is inspired by Django (With such reason, named Schurz, another role in movie _Django Unchained_).

Django is perfect, but too huge to mold it. Flask is lightweight, but it is too flexible to build an tidy project —— everyone has his own preference, it is hard to read other's project.

Schurz build with Flask, but use Flask's toolchain. Maybe classify Schurz as Demo/Example is better.
